I presented 3 posters at ICRA main conference, Workmate workshop and PhD forum.

The first presentation was “Emorl: Continuous acoustic emotion classification using deep reinforcement learning,” at ICRA 2018. The paper is available here: (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04053).

 
I also presented "Learning spatial representation for safe human-robot collaboration in joint manual tasks" at the Workmate workshop at ICRA 2018 ( https://workmate2018.wordpress.com/program/).

 
I also presented my work on "Language-modulated Actions for Safer Human-Robot Interaction using Deep Reinforcement Learning" as a poster in the ICRA 2018 PhD forum (http://icra2018.acfr.usyd.edu.au/).

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's *Slides* feature and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
